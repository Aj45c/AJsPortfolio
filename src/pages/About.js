            I am a General Assembly graduate and spent 3 months honing my ability to learn new skills underpressure. The ability to adapt and
            quickly shift gears is something that GA has made sure all their students achieve. Please take the time to view the projects that I have created
            thus far and see the growth I achieved in those 3 months!
